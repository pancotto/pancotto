# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Pancotto

I'm an **Electrical Engineer** from Brazil, now expanding my career into software development.  
In my daily work as an engineer, I’ve found that programming helps me solve practical problems — from calculations to automation — and that motivated me to dive deeper into coding.  

I’m currently learning **JavaScript, Python, VB.NET and Solidity**, with a strong interest in Web3.  
I believe blockchain will bring more transparency and innovation to industries like energy, finance and beyond, and I want to combine my engineering background with decentralized technologies to build secure and useful solutions.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Interests
- **JavaScript**: algorithms and web development (HTML, CSS)  
- **Python**: automation and engineering problem-solving  
- **VB.NET**: building desktop tools for daily tasks  
- **Solidity**: smart contracts on Ethereum  
- Exploring DAOs and decentralized apps  

---

## 🎯 Goals in Web3
- Write and deploy **smart contracts**  
- Learn to manage assets securely with **Multi-Sig wallets**  
- Apply my **engineering mindset** to decentralized solutions  
- Contribute to real blockchain projects

## 🎵 & 🏀 Life beyond technology
Outside of work and coding, I enjoy:  
- Training at the **gym** 💪  
- **Cycling**, **basketball** and **tennis**  
- Playing **guitar** and listening to **rock music** 🎸  

Sports teach me discipline and balance, while music brings creativity — both qualities that help me in my journey as a developer.
