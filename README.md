# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Pancotto

I'm an **Electrical Engineer**, now expanding my career into software development.  
In my daily work as an engineer, I’ve found that programming helps me solve practical problems and that motivated me to dive deeper into coding.  
I’m currently learning **Python, VB.NET, JavaScript and Solidity**, with a strong interest in Web3.  
I believe blockchain will bring more transparency and innovation to industries like energy, finance and beyond, and I want to combine my engineering background with decentralized technologies to build secure and useful solutions.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Interests
- **Python**: automation and engineering problem-solving  
- **VB.NET**: building desktop tools for daily tasks
- **JavaScript**: algorithms and web development (HTML, CSS) 
- **Solidity**: smart contracts on Ethereum  
- Exploring DAOs and decentralized apps  

---

## 🎯 Goals in Web3
- Write and deploy **smart contracts**  
- Learn to manage assets securely with **Multi-Sig wallets**  
- Apply my **engineering mindset** to decentralized solutions  
- Contribute to real blockchain projects

## 💪 Life beyond technology
Outside of work and coding, I enjoy:  
- Training at the **gym** 
- **Cycling**, **basketball** and **tennis**
- Playing **guitar** and listening to **rock music**

Sports teach me discipline and balance, while music brings creativity — both qualities that help me in my journey as a engineer and developer.
